# ORB_SLAM3 docker

This docker is based on ros melodic ubuntu 18.

There are two versions available:
- CPU based (Xorg Nouveau display)
- Nvidia Cuda based. 

To check if you are running the nvidia driver, simply run `nvidia-smi` and see if get anything.

Based on which graphic driver you are running, you should choose the proper docker. For cuda version, you need to have [nvidia-docker setup](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/install-guide.html) on your machine.
